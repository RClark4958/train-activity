# train-activity

Link to deployed project: https://rclark4958.github.io/train-activity/

This project allows the user to determine the next arrival of a train based on a few inputs. 

Firebase is used to restore and retrieve data. Moment.js is used to manipulate the time that is entered.

The arrival of the next train is calculated based upon the current time.
